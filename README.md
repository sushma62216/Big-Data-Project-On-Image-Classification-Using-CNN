Image Classification on Places 365 Dataset
About the Project
This project aims to classify images of places using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leveraging Azure's cloud services for efficient data processing, training, and deployment. It utilises Places365 dataset obtained from the Kaggle dataset and uploaded to Azure Blob Storage for cloud processing.

The project leverages cloud-based services to optimize data processing, enabling the handling of large image datasets efficiently. By utilizing distributed training, it accelerates the model training process across multiple computational resources, which is crucial for classifying images based on location scenes. This approach ensures scalability, faster model training, and enhanced performance in handling diverse and extensive datasets.
